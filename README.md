#Where Did I Put That?

The app is designed to help the user remember where they put their belongings. The user can add several addresses, rooms, storage units and posessions to the app to later find them using the search function or browing through all locations.

I'm releasing this as open source in hope it will help someone. I might add documentation here in the future, if I have the spare time.
